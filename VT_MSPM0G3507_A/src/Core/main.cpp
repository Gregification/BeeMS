 * eventually someone needs to go though and rewrite this program using
 *      something cool like ETL for safety & good practice. most worried about
 *      dynamic allocations. end goal is to have absolutely no dynamic allocation,
 *      all static. it is possible and is done as such on industry projects.

 * good luck getting the CCS RTOS debugger working. I couldn't.
